    subTitle: 
      'Amir, first-authored of more than 20 scientific papers, has spent the past decade using satellite observations to enhance weather forecasts and chemical transport models. He specializes in optimizing model inputs like emissions through satellite data and has led research on predicting non-linear ozone production. With expertise in handling uncertainties in HCHO/NO2 data, Amir spearheaded this NASA project funded by Aura-ACMAP using advanced statistical methods, including machine learning, to predict PO3 magnitudes and sensitivities. As the creator of the "ozonerates" package, he introduced global PO3 estimations using TROPOMI and OMI data. Amir has also collaborated with TEMPO, MethaneSAT, and MethaneAIR teams at Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (2018-2023), gaining experience in satellite trace gas retrievals.',

      "Gonzalo, has been checking atmospheric composition from space for the past 15 years using infrared, visible and ultraviolet radiation. His work focuses on creating retrieval algorithms to extract gas concentrations from satellite observations. Since joining the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in 2011 (after completing his PhD. at the University of York), Gonzalo has worked with multiple satellite instruments (OMI, OMPS, TROPOMI, TEMPO…) providing valuable datasets of formaldehyde, glyoxal, water vapor and nitrogen dioxide to the air quality and atmospheric composition communities. He brings to the “ozonerates” project his experience with these retrievals and his familiarity with the multiple nuances inherent to satellite observations.",

His research focuses on the application of satellite- and ground-based remote-sensing, in situ measurements, and forward and inverse chemical transport modeling to evaluate processes impacting climate and air quality. His expertise in chemical transport modeling and remote-sensing data application to define processes controlling ozone chemistry led to his collaboration on this project producing the "ozonerates" package. Matthew’s research has resulted in over 70 published manuscripts, and he has been the PI on multiple federally-funded research projects.`,
